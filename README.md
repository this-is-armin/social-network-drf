# Social Network API

This project is a backend API for a social network application. It is built with Django and Django REST Framework and provides endpoints for user accounts, posts, comments, and follow relationships.

The API is versioned (`v1`) to support multiple clients (e.g. web frontend, mobile apps) independently. This makes it scalable and adaptable for future versions or different platforms.
